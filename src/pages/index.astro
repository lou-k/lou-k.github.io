        <br />
        As a research engineer
        specializing in computer vision and machine learning, I spent most of my
        time on tech-transfer: figuring out how to build cutting edge research
        from the lab into real-world applications. 
        <br />
        <br />
        
        I have a passion for startups
        since they let me rapidly switch roles including scientific researcher,
        software engineer, and data scientist. It also means I get to execute
        and impact artificial-intelligence products from idea and feasibility
        phase all the way to a full product.
        <br />
        <br />
         Previously, I received my PhD from
        Drexel University in computer vision. Periodically I serve as an adjunct
        professor teaching graduate level computer vision.
