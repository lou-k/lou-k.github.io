## Description
I gave this lighetening talk many years ago at a meetup I have since forgotten... 
I still think thought the [stream summary data structure](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/comp5331/References/EfficientComputationOfFrequentAndTop-kElementsInDataStreams.pdf) is pretty cool, and it was neat to figure out how to add and subtract them, so I posted these slides.
